# 🚗 Car Dent & Scratch Detection 

Welcome to the **Hybrid-SAM-ResNet and YOLOv8-based Car Defect Detection** repository!  
This project focuses on detecting **car dents** and **scratches**, using **two deep learning models** 

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This repository provides two specialized models:

### 🛠️ YOLOv8 — Best for Small Scratches
- Use this for detecting **minor**, **subtle**, and **fine scratches**.
- Fast and lightweight — ideal for real-time applications.

### 💥 SAM + ResNet50 — Best for Large Dents
- Use this for detecting **major dents** and **larger damage regions**.
- Based on **Segment Anything Model (SAM)** combined with **ResNet50** for high accuracy on complex structures.

## 📂 Dataset Access
The datasets used for training both models are publicly accessible:

- 📦 SAM + ResNet50 Dataset: Download here

- 📦 YOLOv8 Dataset: Download here

## 🎯 Why Two Models?

We use two different models to handle **different types of car defects** effectively:

| 🧠 Model              | 🔍 Use Case                       | 
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **YOLOv8**           | Fine scratches, small defects   
| **SAM + ResNet50**   | Large dents, complex damage
