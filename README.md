# 🚗 Car Dent & Scratch Detection 

Welcome to the **Hybrid-SAM-ResNet and YOLOv8-based Car Defect Detection** repository!  

---

## 🔍 What This Project Does

This repository provides two specialized models:

### 🛠️ YOLOv8 — Best for Small Scratches

### 💥 SAM + ResNet50 — Best for Large Dents

## 📂 Dataset Access
The datasets used for training both models are publicly accessible:

- 📦 **YOLOv8 Dataset**: [Download here!](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1x3LlqD69-Rs5ejY6hfKUnaYkw1BfEbUg?usp=drive_link)

## 🎯 Why Two Models?

We use two different models to handle **different types of car defects** effectively:

| 🧠 Model              | 🔍 Use Case                       | 
|----------------------|----------------------------------|
| **YOLOv8**           | Fine scratches, small defects   
| **SAM + ResNet50**   | Large dents, complex damage
